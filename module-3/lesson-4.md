# Lesson 4 - Introduction to GraphQL

## Introduction

<a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> provides a different type of API to REST APIs.

In a REST API you have multiple endpoints all returning different data or performing different requests.

With GraphQL, there is only one endpoint and you send this endpoint a query telling the API what you want to do and what you want returned.

The video below looks at making a request (the equivalent of a REST API GET request) using the Apollo client and the <a href="https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/" target="_blank">GraphQLZero</a> fake GraphQL API.
