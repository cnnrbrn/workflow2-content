# Lesson 3 - Running tests in React

## Introduction

This is a very brief introduction to running tests in a React project.

Testing in React will be covered in more detail in the JavaScript frameworks course.

## Running tests in Create React Apps

When using Create React App to scaffold a new app, no configuration is required to run tests, you can simply run the `test` script found in package.json:

```bash
npm run test
```

In the video below, a new React app has been created with Create React App and the `checkName` function and its test have been added to the `src/utils`.

## Test file names and locations

Test files need to have `.test.js` or `.spec.js` file extension, or be located in a `__tests__` folder - that's two underscores on each side.

If located in a `__tests__` folder the file extension only needs to be `.js`.
